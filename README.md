# com-linear-drv
Commutator linear drive harp device.

Provides control of the treadmill's drive belt and tilt mechanism from Bonsai.

## Dependencies
The target must be running a firmware image built from the v1.18-swc branch of the micropython project.

Additionally, the SWC microharp package must be present on the filesystem of the target.
