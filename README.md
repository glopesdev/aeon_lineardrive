# com-linear-drv
Commutator linear drive harp device.

Provides control of the linear drive to control the position of the commutator from Bonsai.

## Dependencies
The target must be running a firmware image built from the v1.18-swc branch of the micropython project.

Additionally, the SWC microharp package must be present on the filesystem of the target.

| Write | 43 | S32 | pos | Tilt mechanism goto pos [-32768, 32767] TODO: units. |
| Event | 44 | S32 | pos | Tilt mechanism current pos [-32768, 32767] TODO: units. |
| Write | 45 | U16 | spd | Tilt mechanism speed limit, default 2000. |
| Write | 46 | U16 | ctl | Continuous current limit of drive, default 900. |
| Write | 47 | U16 | ctl | Peak current limit of drive, default 900. |
| Write | 48 | U8 | ctl | Position limit range control, 0 = disable, 1 = enable. |

## Quick Start
To control the position of the linear drive;
- set home
- enable the drive
- set position
